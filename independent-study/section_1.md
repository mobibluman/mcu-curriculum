From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding):

> Worldbuilding is the process of constructing an imaginary world, sometimes associated with a whole fictional universe. The term "world-building" was first used in the Edinburgh Review in December 1820 and appeared in A.S. Eddington's *Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory* (1920) to describe the thinking out of hypothetical worlds with different physical laws. The term has been used in science fiction and fantasy criticism since appearing in R.A. Lupoffâ€™s *Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure* (1965)...Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a history, geography, and ecology is a key task for many science fiction or fantasy writers. Worldbuilding often involves the creation of maps, a backstory, and people for the world...Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and mental exercise, or for specific creative endeavors such as novels, video games, or role-playing games.

How will we be worldbuilding?

### Narrative

Most creative work involves narrative, and Minecraft map building is no different. The stronger the narrative that our map/modpack creates, the more invested players will become while playing it.

We will ask ourselves related questions in the forthcoming design phase, but it is useful for now to simply consider what all writers ask themselves before starting on a creative work.

#### SOAPS

Speaker, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Subject

##### Who is the Speaker?

**The voice that tells the story**. Before students begin to write, they must decide whose voice is going to be heard. Whether this voice belongs to a fictional character or to the writers themselves, students should determine how to insert and develop those attributes of the speaker that will influence the perceived meaning of the piece.

##### What is the Occasion?

**The time and the place of the piece**; the context that prompted the writing. Writing does not occur in a vacuum. All writers are influenced by the larger occasion: an environment of ideas, attitudes, and emotions that swirl around a broad issue. Then there is the immediate occasion: an event or situation that catches the writer's attention and triggers a response.

##### Who is the Audience? 

**The group of readers to whom this piece is directed**. As they begin to write, students must determine who the audience is that they intend to address. It may be one person or a specific group. This choice of audience will affect how and why students write a particular text.

##### What is the Purpose?

**The reason behind the text**. Students need to consider the purpose of the text in order to develop the thesis or the argument and its logic. They should ask themselves, "What do I want my audience to think or do as a result of reading my text?"

##### What is the Subject? 

Students should be able to state the subject in a few words or phrases. This step helps them to focus on the intended task throughout the writing process.

## Homework:

##### Watch [Worldbuilding: Mutual Acts of Creation](https://vimeo.com/63532147)

Answer the following:

* How does the narrator describe Parameters?
* What are some of the other worldbuilding examples the narrator posits?
* What do the "texts" posed as examples do to the "reader"?
* What kind of worldbuilding occurs inside Minecraft? Around the Minecraft ecosystem?

##### Play the [Hexxit modpack](http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/hexxit.552552)

...it is included by default in the Technic launcher (the same one the Minecraft U modpack uses).

Answer the following:

* What was the goal of the Hexxit authors? What did they want Minecraft to do that it did not already?
* What parts of gameplay are easier? Which are more difficult?

## Extra credit

##### Watch the rest of [Alex McDowell: World Building and Narrative](https://vimeo.com/141454667)

##### Play the [Life in the Woods modpack](http://www.lifeinthewoods.ca/).

* What did the author of Life in the Woods want to change about Minecraft? 
* What did they want players to be able to experience?
